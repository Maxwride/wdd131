    <h3>About us</h3>
    <p>
      This website is meant to help you choose a good paddle based on the type
      of player that you are. There are so many options but this website hopes
      to narrow it down for you.

    <h3>Why a good paddle?</h3>
    <p>
      A good paddle can really shape your game depending on the type of player
      that you are. For example less expensive paddles don't have an even
      hitting surface. By upgrading your paddle game you will receive a paddle
      that is even all the way around.
